Contributing
============

## Pull requests

* Please do pull requests to the `master` branch
* Before opening a PR, please **rebase from master**. Rebasing keeps history easier to follow, lets you solve any conflicts before the merge and CI tests run against what the code looks like after merging, giving us more confidence.


## Read the README and CONTRIBUTING
* Seriously, [read it](README.md). It changes from time to time, so every time you want to contribute please take a look at it and also at this file to check if something's new.
